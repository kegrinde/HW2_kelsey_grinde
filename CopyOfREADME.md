BIOST 578A HW#2

This is the second homework assignment for BIOST 578A. This homework is due Tuesday, February 10.

There are two questions (source: https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578/blob/master/HW2.md):

1. Use the GEOmetabd package to find all HCV gene expression data using the Illumina platform submitted by an investigator at Yale. This should be done with a single query, showing the title, the GSE accession number, the GPL accession number and the manufacturer and the description of the platform used.

2. Reproduce your above query using the data.table package. Again, try to use a single line of code. [Hint: You first need to convert all db tables to data.table tables].

Please submit your code as an Rmd file that can be used to check your queries and show the results. You need to make sure you ignore all output files.
